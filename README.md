# Envato Tuts+ Tutorial: [Create a WordPress Image Gallery: Code the Plugin][published url]
## Instructor: [Rachel McCollin][instructor url]

People like pictures. They like looking at them, they like clicking on them. So it makes sense to use them in the navigation for your site.

You may already use featured images in your archive pages, letting users get a greater insight into what a post is about and making your archive pages look better. The nice big clickable image also makes the process of navigating through to a page or post more intuitive.

But there are other places where you can use featured images to aid navigation to parts of your WordPress site. In this two-part tutorial, we'll show you how to create a grid of images which link to the child pages of a given page in your site, or to the child pages of the current page.

In this first part, I'll demonstrate how to write the PHP to fetch the pages and output their titles and featured images, inside links. And in the second part, Ian Yates will show you how to add CSS to turn your list into a great-looking grid.
